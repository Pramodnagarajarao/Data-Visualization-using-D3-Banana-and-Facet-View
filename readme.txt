Open index.html from 'homepage' directory. Make sure 'D3' directory and 'Team 33 Facetview Search' directory are in the root directory as 'homepage' directory


Executing D3:

Executing D3 is simple. Select the D3 format you wish and it will load it in a new window.
Host the server that we have used which is PHP using apache server configured to overcome CORS and execute python scripts
Move D3 folder to root of project and access to apache server.
configure htdocs to include python scripts

Executing Facet View:

Once the server is loaded, we have 3 tabs showing which tab is for what
so clicking on it will lead you to the place where you can query using the facets that are present


Executing Banana:
